# Creating BTCPayServer invoices - the tutorial
==========================

## About this tutorial
This tutorial contains five scripts. These scripts allow you to do the following:
1) Create keys to communicate with BTCPayServer's API
2) Pair your keys to your BTCPayServer merchant account
3) Create BTCPayServer invoices
4) Display a BTCPayServer invoice using BTCPayServer's hosted payment page
5) Log Instant Payment Notifications (IPNs, also called webhooks)

Script 001 & 002 need to be executed once, to properly configure your local installation.

Script 003 creates BTCPayServer invoices; this script can be run permanently.
Script 004 is very similar to script 003. The main difference is that script 004 outputs HTML, so you can run this on your webserver.

IPNs will be sent after a BTCPayServer invoice receives a payment. IPNs can be logged or processed with IPNlogger.php

## Getting started
To begin please visit https://test.btcpayserver.com/dashboard/signup and register for a BTCPayServer merchant test account. Please fill in all questions, so you get a fully working test account. When filling in the settlement address in your BTCPayServer merchant test account, make sure to fill in a testnet bitcoin address (starting with m or n).

If you are looking for a testnet bitcoin wallet to test with, please visit https://btcpayserver.com/wallet and create a new wallet.

If you need testnet bitcoin please visit a testnet faucet, e.g. https://testnet.coinfaucet.eu/en/ or http://tpfaucet.appspot.com/

For more information about testing, please see https://btcpayserver.com/docs/testing

To install BTCPayServer's latest PHP library, please follow the instructions from https://github.com/btcpayserver/php-bitpay-client/blob/master/README.md

## Script 1 & 2: configure your local installation
The following two scripts need to be executed once. These scripts will generate your private/public keys and pair them to your BTCPayServer merchant account:
1. 001_generateKeys.php : generates the private/public keys to sign the communication with BTCPayServer. The private/public keys are stored in your filesystem for later usage.
2. 002_pair.php : pairs your private/public keys to your BTCPayServer merchant account. Please make sure to first create a pairing code in your BTCPayServer merchant account (Payment Tools -> Manage API tokens -> Add new token -> Add token) and put this 7 character pairing code in the script. The script returns an API token that should be put put in 003_createInvoice.php, to create invoices permanently.

These first two scripts need to be executed only once.

## Script 3: create a BTCPayServer invoice
3. 003_createInvoice.php : creates a BTCPayServer invoice. Please make sure to update the script with the API token received from 002_pair.php

This script returns a BTCPayServer invoice object. You can display the invoice by loading the invoice URL in a web browser. You can pay the invoice with your bitcoin wallet.

## Script 4: display a BTCPayServer invoice using BTCPayServer's hosted payment page
4. 004_HostedPaymentPage.php : creates a BTCPayServer invoice and returns the HTML to show the invoice. Please make sure to update the script with the API token received from 002_pair.php

For more information about paying a BTCPayServer invoice, please see https://support.btcpayserver.com/hc/en-us/articles/203281456-How-do-I-pay-a-BTCPayServer-invoice-

Script 003_createInvoice.php and 004_HostedPaymentPage.php can be run permanently with the token from 002_pair.php

## Script 5: log Instant Payment Notifications
After you've paid the invoice, BTCPayServer will send an IPN to the notificationURL of the invoice. A script to process the IPN should be put on your server and be reachable from the internet. Your should put the URL of IPNLogger.php in 003_createInvoice.php, e.g.:
```
// You will receive IPN's at this URL, should be HTTPS for security purposes!
$invoice->setNotificationUrl('https://yourserver.com/IPNlogger.php');
```
IPNs can be used by the merchant to update order statuses. Please note to use IPNs as a trigger to fetch the BTCPayServer invoice status, since the IPNs are not authenticated.

For more information about IPNs see https://btcpayserver.com/docs/invoice-callbacks
