Contributing to Documentation
=============================

Documentation is generated with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) and can
easily be updated. Once you have Sphinx installed, you just need to run
the command "make html" in the docs/ directory and view the output in
the \_build directory. It's all HTML files so you should not have any
issues testing.
